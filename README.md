Submission for KJSCE Hackathon 2018 [Voices of Mumbai]

## VoicesOfMumbai
The android app is to be used by the users to voice the problems they are facing. The users get a feed of problems reported by other users and also problems repoted/acknowledged by the authorities. Authenticating has been implemented using the user's phone number and an OTP being sent to the user. The user can also see the problems being reported locality wise marked on the map of Mumbai(the city he resides in). This would serve as a platform for the authorities as well as residents to monitor their locality. The locality of the user is taken from his current location while posting a complaint regarding the problem he/she is facing.
